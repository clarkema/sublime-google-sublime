======================

I'm coming to Sublime Text from Vim, and learning it as a secondary
editor in order that I can support people I wouldn't inflict my first
choice of editor on.  I seem to be spending a lot of time opening up
browser windows and Googling for the Sublime Way(tm) of doing
familiar operations, and it's getting old.

This Sublime Text 3 plugin adds a command to the editor to make it
quick and easy to open a new browser window Googling for

    sublime text 3 $SEARCH_TERM

The default keymapping on all three platforms is `ctrl-alt-s'.
